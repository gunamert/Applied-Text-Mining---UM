# # Assignment 1
# 
# In this assignment, you'll be working with messy medical data and using regex to extract relevant infromation from the data. 
# 
# Each line of the `dates.txt` file corresponds to a medical note. Each note has a date that needs to be extracted, but each date is encoded in one of many formats.
# 
# The goal of this assignment is to correctly identify all of the different date variants encoded in this dataset and to properly normalize and sort the dates. 
# 
# Here is a list of some of the variants you might encounter in this dataset:
# * 04/20/2009; 04/20/09; 4/20/09; 4/3/09
# * Mar-20-2009; Mar 20, 2009; March 20, 2009;  Mar. 20, 2009; Mar 20 2009;
# * 20 Mar 2009; 20 March 2009; 20 Mar. 2009; 20 March, 2009
# * Mar 20th, 2009; Mar 21st, 2009; Mar 22nd, 2009
# * Feb 2009; Sep 2009; Oct 2010
# * 6/2008; 12/2009
# * 2009; 2010
# 
# Once you have extracted these date patterns from the text, the next step is to sort them in ascending chronological order accoring to the following rules:
# * Assume all dates in xx/xx/xx format are mm/dd/yy
# * Assume all dates where year is encoded in only two digits are years from the 1900's (e.g. 1/5/89 is January 5th, 1989)
# * If the day is missing (e.g. 9/2009), assume it is the first day of the month (e.g. September 1, 2009).
# * If the month is missing (e.g. 2010), assume it is the first of January of that year (e.g. January 1, 2010).
# * Watch out for potential typos as this is a raw, real-life derived dataset.
# 
# With these rules in mind, find the correct date in each note and return a pandas Series in chronological order of the original Series' indices.
# 
# For example if the original series was this:
# 
#     0    1999
#     1    2010
#     2    1978
#     3    2015
#     4    1985
# 
# Your function should return this:
# 
#     0    2
#     1    4
#     2    0
#     3    1
#     4    3
# 
# Your score will be calculated using [Kendall's tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient), a correlation measure for ordinal data.
# 
# *This function should return a Series of length 500 and dtype int.*
